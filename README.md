## Features

### Modules and Structure

The project follows a modular structure for better organization and maintainability. Key modules include:

- `AppModule`: The root module of the application.
- `SharedModule`: Contains shared components, directives, and pipes used across the application.
- `JosModule`: Contains necessary components for this featyre.

### Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is implemented to improve application performance by loading modules asynchronously when needed. Key lazy-loaded modules include:


### Reactive Forms

Reactive forms are used for form handling, providing a more robust and scalable approach compared to template-driven forms. Features include:

- Form creation using `FormBuilder`.
- Validation using built-in validators and custom validators.
